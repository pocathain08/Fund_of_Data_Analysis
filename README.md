# Fund_of_Data_Analysis
Repository for the FDA Assignment
This assessment concerns the well-known tips dataset. It will be described and analised using the Python packages seaborn and jupyter .  

#Description
The first part of my repository will use descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset. 
I started this by sreating a repository and cloning using the cmd interface. After this, I downloaded the tips dataframe as a CVS file to the project folder. I also imported all the libraries that I felt I would need. I then looked at at the data shape and info and checked for missing elements of the df using df.info. I changed the col names to one capitalised word. This is to make it look a little better but also to make the Col easier to call for later analysis. 

I then looked at a A scatter plot matrix of the data, this is a collection of variables where each of the variables will be plotted against each other (Ref: https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781784390150/4/ch04lvl1sec37/a-scatter-plot-matrix).
I also called a plot of the data, showing Bill, Party and Tip.

One of the key relationships that I was curious about we what factor most influenced the amount of the tip. From the Scatter matrix, it would seem that males (in red dots) tended to be slight outliers. The majority of the dots were concentrated away from the origin were red, representing males, but with a few green dots also.
Looking at the Party/Bill and Party/tips, both plots look very similar, which suggests that there is a correlation between party size and tips. But equally, the Bill/Bill and Tips/Tips histograms also look similar. 



#Regression: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.

#Analyse: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish â€” for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those. This part is worth 40%.
